# Python
This is a special repository for python challenges for Hacktoberfest 2020. I will keep adding issues which you are free to solve and raise a PR. You can also add your own issues and solve them. A PR that doesnt solve an issue will NOT be accepted. Multiple people are allowed to work on the same issue, however I will close an issue after more than 5 people have solved it. Open PRs only after 1st october otherwise it wont count.
